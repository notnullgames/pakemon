# Pak√©mon

Short for "packet monitor/monster". Gamified fun device/platform for hacking technology around you.

## local dev

There is a Makefile included with a few targets for dev. Run `make` for help.

There is a docker-compose network you can explore, use `docker-compose exec pakemon bash` to get a nice console on the main entry-point machine (running kali.)
