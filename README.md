You should have love in your path. Run `love src` to strart frontend.

## local dev

There is a Makefile included with a few targets for dev. Run `make` for help.

While it's running, there is a web debugger [here](http://localhost:8000). There is also a docker-compose network you can explore, use `docker-compose exec pakemon bash` to get a nice console on the main entry-point machine (running kali.)
